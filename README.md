# TRAFFIC SIGN CLASSIFICATION â€“ COMP30027 PROJECT 2 (2025)

## Overview:
This project aims to classify German traffic signs into one of 43 classes using extracted features. 

## Directory Structure:
The project is organized as follows:
```

## Data:
- 5488 training images with class labels
- 2353 test images without labels
- 43 total traffic sign classes
- Provided features:
    * HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) - PCA reduced
    * Color histograms
    * Additional features (edge density, texture variance, mean RGB)

## Submission Format (Kaggle) (CSV):
Final submission should follow this structure:

| id | ClassId |
| -- | ------- |
| 67 | 4 |
| 94 | 2 |
| ... | ... |
| 521 | 12 |

## Python Version:
`3.9.19`

## Requirments:
- numpy
- pandas
- opencv
- tqdm
- pillow
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image

## Run Order
To reproduce the workflow, run the following notebooks in order:
1. feature_extraction.ipynb
2. feature_processing.ipynb
3. classifier_trainiing.ipynb
4. hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb

The CNN model defined in `traffic-sign-classification-cnn.ipynb` was trained using accelerator GPU T4*2 on Kaggle.

The dataset used for training and testing was downloaded from the LMS platform and uploaded to Kaggle manually. The folder structure is as follows:

```
2025_A2/
|- train/
|   |- img_000001.jpg
|   |- ...
|- test/
    |- img_005489.jpg
    |- ...
```

The best-performing model and the corresponding test prediction results are saved in the `/kaggle/working/` directory.
